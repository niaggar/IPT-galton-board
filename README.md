# IPT-galton-board
Code implementation to solve the Galton board problem

> ## Question:
> Dropping a set of beads on a board with evenly distributed pegs results in a binomial distribution. Is it posible to generate other kinds of distribution by varying some parameters (Pegs size, pegs distribution, bead format, etc)? Is it possible to achive a distribution that does not obey the central limit theorem in an IID scenario?
